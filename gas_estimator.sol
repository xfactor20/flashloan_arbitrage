// To get the current gas price and estimate the amount of gas a transaction will use in Solidity, we'll need to utilize an oracle service, like Chainlink. Chainlink oracles are decentralized services that provide smart contracts with external data. However, it's important to note that getting the current gas price and estimating the amount of gas a transaction will use can be complex due to the dynamic nature of Ethereum's gas prices and the specific computations required for a transaction.

// Here's a simplified example of how this could be implemented:



pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract GasEstimator {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;
    
    constructor() public {
        // Chainlink Price Feed address to get the gas price
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x8468b2bDCE073A157E560AA4D9CcF6dB1DB98507);
    }
    
    function getLatestGasPrice() public view returns (int) {
        (,int answer,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        return answer;
    }

    function estimateTransactionGas() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 gasPrice = uint256(getLatestGasPrice());
        // Estimate gas here. This will depend on the specific transaction
        uint256 estimatedGas = 21000;  // A simple transfer usually costs 21000 gas
        return gasPrice * estimatedGas;
    }
}



// This example uses Chainlink's Fast Gas / Gwei Price Feed (on Ethereum Mainnet) to get the latest gas price. It then estimates the gas for a simple transfer transaction (21,000 gas). Replace the estimateTransactionGas function implementation with your own estimate logic for the specific transactions your contract will be executing.

// Please note that this is a simplified example. Actual gas estimation can be more complex and could depend on a number of factors including the specifics of the transactions you are performing, the state of the Ethereum network, and the current gas price.

// Remember that Solidity code should be thoroughly tested before being deployed on a live blockchain network. Always consider possible security implications and best practices when writing your contracts
